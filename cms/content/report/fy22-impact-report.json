      "content": "**Welcome to the 10x Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Impact Report!**\n\nThis is the sixth year in a row that we've published our annual impact report. Again we start with a letter from the team.\n\nThis year, team means something a bit different to us. The team behind this year's letter is a whole lot bigger and looks a whole lot different than the team who wrote last year's letter. At the beginning of FY22, we had fewer than 10 full-time employees. By the end, we had enough staff to fill a medium-sized conference room for an IRL (in real life) meeting, and then some. During the 10x IRL we also learned that at least one of us can carry a tune.\n\nBut something we knew already — because we carefully selected for it while expanding the team — is that we all are dedicated to innovating for the public good. It's this fact that has always animated the 10x team, whenever and whatever the size.\n\nInnovating for the public good naturally comes with challenges, and FY22 brought many But teams come together when they have to tackle new challenges together.\n\nOne important challenge we faced was resurrecting projects that 10x had funded  that had gone cold, but then suddenly found new relevance in FY22. Twice during the fiscal year, the government renewed its interest in government technology where 10x has already invested significant time and energy:\n\n- a governmentwide notifications service\n\n- grants modernization\n\n10x lacks a consistent process for revisiting old projects that had either graduated or fizzled out. But we jumped at the opportunity when we had the chance to resurface everything we learned and built to help out with new efforts.\n\nWe'll explain how and why we revived these older projects. We'll also cover developments on other 10x projects, hear directly from some 10x delivery team members, and explore some of the ideas we've developed over the last year through 10x dark matter.\n\nDespite the major changes we experienced during FY22, we still believe that the government must make room for innovation, because innovation can improve lives.\n\nWe hope this report will convey some of the impact we've delivered for the public over the last year and inspire civil servants everywhere to believe in the value of their own ideas.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Newer—and Bigger —10x Team",

      "lede": "We sum up 10x’s FY22  in three sentences: We grew a lot. Our projects achieved a lot of milestones. And we delivered results with funding from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nHere’s what we did:",
      "content": "### A growing team.\n\nWe grew from a staff of four full-time staff at the beginning of FY22 to 37 by the end. That’s a lot of growth and change in a short amount of time. Up until FY22, we relied on talented technologists from outside our own program, either from elsewhere in government or from the private sector, to staff our projects.\n\nIn FY22, we stood up a team of technologists, tapped into another talent pool from another government within the government, added staff to the 10x program management office, and welcomed new US Digital Corps Fellows to our team.\n\nAs most people working in government know, rapidly standing up an entire team within one fiscal year is no small feat.\n\nWe had toyed with the idea of building an internal delivery team for years, rather than relying exclusively on staffing from external sources. There were a few reasons we’d been thinking about this for so long.\n\nFirst, we wanted to streamline the process to get our projects moving more quickly. One challenge of relying on external staffing is that the demand for talented technologists in government outsrips the supply. This meant that 10x was only one team of many looking for staff from the same talent pools.\n\nDeveloping an internal staffing model brought us more predictable and reliable access to the talent we need. Bringing our technologists in-house will help build institutional knowledge. It’s always better when the same team can work on the project throughout its lifecycle.\n\nBut that wasn’t always an option the way that the previous staffing worked.\n\nEmbedding more talent within our program will allow us to increase  the number of projects we’re able to explore.  Embedding talent makes it easier and faster to staff our projects. Now we can avoid the hassle of assembling new teams with new paperwork on each project, and sometimes even between project phases.\n\nSecond, having a dedicated delivery team reduces the burden of navigating financial agreements with our various service providers. These agreements take time and can delay  projects. Saving time here is particularly important when projects are between phases, because  an extended lull in work saps momentum and dampens enthusiasm.\n\nThird, an internal delivery team helps us maintain consistent team structures on projects over the project’s multiphase life cycle. In the past, we've faced situations where an entire project team turned over  in a  project’s phases. This disrupts  the project vision, personal connections with stakeholders, and established team norms during these transitions.\n\nFinally, we felt that bringing more talent in-house would keep our projects fresh. With our previous staffing model, once a project finished, the staff would be reassigned to other work, often non-10x projects. If a completed project got noticed or inquiries came in, no one could answer the phone because the people closest to the work had already moved on.\n\nWith permanent staff, we’ll have someone with firsthand project experience available even after work on any completed project.",
      "content2": "### Project Successes.\n\n“What do bears and pets have in common?”\n\nIf you were thinking, “They’re both animals”, then you’d be wrong. They’re actually both 10x projects. Many of our projects have delivered results in FY22, but we’ll highlight two: BEARS and PETS.",
      "content2_calloutProject": "Benefits Eligibility Awareness Resource Service (BEARS)",
      "content3": "The BEARS project helps the government meet people where they are. BEARS helps he public learn about government benefits they may be eligible for based on their  life events. For example, a survivor of a natural disaster may be eligible for services like financial aid for home repairs or certain types of tax relief. But completely different agencies offer these benefits. And uncovering what benefits are out there, who’s eligible for them, and how to apply can be confusing and time consuming.\n\nThe problem? This situation burdens people in vulnerable situations. At a difficult time, they have to navigate  complex government bureaucracies when they need help the most.\n\nWe believe that saving people time—the hours it would take to navigate different agency web portals and FAQ pages— could let them do what they really want to do: grieve and recover during hard times. If innovation might help reduce this burden, then it was worth a 10x investment.\n\n**In FY22, we’re closing the project after four successful phases.** We launched the benefits locator tool in beta for a loved one’s death. We’ve handed off the tech stack and responsibility to our capable partners at USA.gov. They  will continue  to scale the benefits locator tool into the future.\n\nAnd when they do, they’ll be sure to include some nice occasions too, like giving birth or retiring. For more on BEARS, see the description on our projects page.",
      "content4_calloutProject": "Deploying Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)",
      "content4": "The goal of Our Deploying PETs project is to challenge the way the government thinks about, uses, and exchanges data. It shows how newly available technologies have opened ways to transform.\n\nOne group of these new technologies is called Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). They allow  computation on granular data that is kept private by design. Through this project, we’re finding out what role PETs can play in digital public service, and to see if adopting them could improve how the government ‘does data.’\n\nThis project is currently in Phase Three, where our teams are testing the research and hypotheses from the earlier phases by building working software.\n\nIn FY22, the US Census Bureau and a group of national statistical agencies from other countries entered into a PET pilot sponsored by the newly created PET Lab at the United Nations.\n\nOne of the teams from the Census Bureau are the folks from [xD](https://www.xd.gov/), who have been working on 10x emerging technology projects for years. The pilot’s goal  is for countries to experiment with PETs and learn what they could do  for government.\n\nIn the pilot, each statistical agency (chosen because of how they expertly manage massive amounts of data) develops a node within their agencies. Each of these nodes can interact with each other—using PET methods—to test open trade data.\n\nIf the pilot proves that PET adoption in government is both technically feasible and valuable, then the pilot could scale to the types of highly sensitive private datasets that PET is designed to use.\n\nWe view this project as a success. Finding committed and capable organizations to partner with to test and adopt our technology is one of the trickiest parts of 10x. This project has gone above and beyond finding a partner.\n\nNot only has xD Census begun scaling PET experiments within the U.S. government, but it has also scaled PET experiments but to other governments—and even the United Nations! No matter what comes out of the pilot implementation, we’ve already made a difference  by introducing a new concept to the government and getting people comfortable with doing government technology differently.",
      "content5": "### American Rescue Plan.\n\n___On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act into law. This  $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package is designed to boost the country’s recovery from the severe economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to addressing the public health and economic crises, the ARP provides emergency funding to upgrade federal information technology infrastructure and address the recent breaches of federal government data systems. The fund that makes 10x possible is called the Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF). The FCSF received $150 million as part of the ARP to support governmentwide citizen-facing services.. Some of that funding came to 10x. We want to be open and transparent about how we use ARP funding. Here are some of the  projects we supported in FY22 using American Rescue Plan Funding.___\n\n",
      "content6_calloutProject": "Identity Alerts for Government",
      "content6": "The federal government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by expanding the eligibility criteria for many existing social safety net programs and created new ways for struggling Americans to get help when they needed it most.\n\nUnfortunately, swindlers, grifters, fraudsters, criminals, troublemakers and scammers took opportunities to benefit from the expanded government assistance. Fraud and identity theft increased exponentially. Identity theft and benefit claims fraud resulted in millions of people suffering financial hardship and the stress of cleaning up their stolen identities—all during a global pandemic.\n\n10x is looking into developing an Identity Alert Service that will allow members of the public to voluntarily sign up to receive notifications when their personal information is used to apply for government services and benefits. This service will build trust and strengthen social safety net programs across the government. It can also help prevent fraud, and could scale to use cases beyond submitting applications for benefits.\n\n10x chose to fund this project out of ARP funding because we saw the direct relationship  between what this project could achieve and what the ARP is all about: \n\nIt’s\n\n- directly related to the pandemic recovery\n\n- could benefit from other 10x efforts (including US Notify, described below),\n\n- would create a better customer experience for the public, and \n\n- helps reimagine government service delivery, which is one of the guiding principles that TTS holds to in releasing ARP funds for investment.\n\n__Identity Alerts for Government is ongoing in Phase Two.__",
      "content7_calloutProject": "US Notify",
      "content7": "Most people get easily accessible communications from the companies whose products they use:\n\n- An SMS message from a bank asking to confirm a large purchase.\n\n- A responsive customer service team that answers email inquiries within one business day.\n\n - Alerts from a telecom provider letting you know about pre-approved available phone upgrades.\n\nBut these easy two-way communications are not as common in the federal  government.  Many of the products or services the government offers  are not consumer-oriented. Instead, they’re intended to help those in need.\n\nA good example is public benefits. To the frustration of many, local governments that administer benefits programs are rarely able to easily update people on their application’s status. If they can’t reliably notify people, agencies can’t let people know about new services they may be eligible for, like disaster assistance or extended unemployment insurance.\n\nThe government should be able to notify the public about things that matter to them, in a way that meets them where they are.\n\nThe work 10x has been doing is the latest effort to date to pursue a multi-channel (SMS, email, etc.) notifications platform available to agencies across the government. There’s a lot of support for this idea at TTS right now, and we’re being encouraged to find the best place for TTS to intervene.\n\nUS Notify has graduated 10x at Phase Three as a fully functional product that allows agencies to send SMS messages. We ended this project at Phase Three because we found a place for it to live and thrive: The Public Benefits Studio within TTS.\n\nThat team will own and develop US Notify further and is actively recruiting customers.\n\n#### Background\n\nFirst, our organization—the Technology Transformation Services (TTS)—felt ready to tackle an idea that had been simmering for a while in the government:  a shared notifications platform.\n\nThis platform is for agencies to use to communicate with the public. In 2018, 10x funded a project called ___Notifications-as-a-Service___. The project got through Phase Two, but we didn’t fund the project for Phase Three because  the timing wasn’t quite right.\n\nBut the landscape has changed since then, and we’re now ready to explore ideas for new shared services. All the research and prototyping that we’ve done in this space is newly relevant. We used it to build and successfully test a messaging capability. \n\nWe’ve also handed off that product to the TTS Public Benefits Studio, a new team within TTS. It  focuses on building and scaling software products that improve public benefits delivery across benefits programs. The Public Benefits Studio will continue to sustain and grow the notifications platform–now called ___US Notify___–into the future."

We work hard to ensure that our products can succeed in a post-10x life.\n\nBut  our approach makes it difficult for us to keep up with our projects once they are no longer in our pipeline. This is particularly true when the most meaningful impact might look different from immediate product adoption or financial returns.\n\nFor this year’s Impact Report, we caught up with a few projects that we nurtured from idea to scale.
