      "content": "**Welcome to the 10x Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Impact Report!**\n\nThis is the sixth year in a row that we've published our annual impact report. Again we start with a letter from the team.\n\nThis year, team means something a bit different to us. The team behind this year's letter is a whole lot bigger and looks a whole lot different than the team who wrote last year's letter. At the beginning of FY22, we had fewer than 10 full-time employees. By the end, we had enough staff to fill a medium-sized conference room for an IRL (in real life) meeting, and then some. During the 10x IRL we also learned that at least one of us can carry a tune.\n\nBut something we knew already — because we carefully selected for it while expanding the team — is that we all are dedicated to innovating for the public good. It's this fact that has always animated the 10x team, whenever and whatever the size.\n\nInnovating for the public good naturally comes with challenges, and FY22 brought many But teams come together when they have to tackle new challenges together.\n\nOne important challenge we faced was resurrecting projects that 10x had funded  that had gone cold, but then suddenly found new relevance in FY22. Twice during the fiscal year, the government renewed its interest in government technology where 10x has already invested significant time and energy:\n\n- a governmentwide notifications service\n\n- grants modernization\n\n10x lacks a consistent process for revisiting old projects that had either graduated or fizzled out. But we jumped at the opportunity when we had the chance to resurface everything we learned and built to help out with new efforts.\n\nWe'll explain how and why we revived these older projects. We'll also cover developments on other 10x projects, hear directly from some 10x delivery team members, and explore some of the ideas we've developed over the last year through 10x dark matter.\n\nDespite the major changes we experienced during FY22, we still believe that the government must make room for innovation, because innovation can improve lives.\n\nWe hope this report will convey some of the impact we've delivered for the public over the last year and inspire civil servants everywhere to believe in the value of their own ideas.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Newer—and Bigger —10x Team",

      "lede": "We sum up 10x’s FY22  in three sentences: We grew a lot. Our projects achieved a lot of milestones. And we delivered results with funding from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nHere’s what we did:",
      "content": "### A growing team.\n\nWe grew from a staff of four full-time staff at the beginning of FY22 to 37 by the end. That’s a lot of growth and change in a short amount of time. Up until FY22, we relied on talented technologists from outside our own program, either from elsewhere in government or from the private sector, to staff our projects.\n\nIn FY22, we stood up a team of technologists, tapped into another talent pool from another government within the government, added staff to the 10x program management office, and welcomed new US Digital Corps Fellows to our team.\n\nAs most people working in government know, rapidly standing up an entire team within one fiscal year is no small feat.\n\nWe had toyed with the idea of building an internal delivery team for years, rather than relying exclusively on staffing from external sources. There were a few reasons we’d been thinking about this for so long.\n\nFirst, we wanted to streamline the process to get our projects moving more quickly. One challenge of relying on external staffing is that the demand for talented technologists in government outsrips the supply. This meant that 10x was only one team of many looking for staff from the same talent pools.\n\nDeveloping an internal staffing model brought us more predictable and reliable access to the talent we need. Bringing our technologists in-house will help build institutional knowledge. It’s always better when the same team can work on the project throughout its lifecycle.\n\nBut that wasn’t always an option the way that the previous staffing worked.\n\nEmbedding more talent within our program will allow us to increase  the number of projects we’re able to explore.  Embedding talent makes it easier and faster to staff our projects. Now we can avoid the hassle of assembling new teams with new paperwork on each project, and sometimes even between project phases.\n\nSecond, having a dedicated delivery team reduces the burden of navigating financial agreements with our various service providers. These agreements take time and can delay  projects. Saving time here is particularly important when projects are between phases, because  an extended lull in work saps momentum and dampens enthusiasm.\n\nThird, an internal delivery team helps us maintain consistent team structures on projects over the project’s multiphase life cycle. In the past, we've faced situations where an entire project team turned over  in a  project’s phases. This disrupts  the project vision, personal connections with stakeholders, and established team norms during these transitions.\n\nFinally, we felt that bringing more talent in-house would keep our projects fresh. With our previous staffing model, once a project finished, the staff would be reassigned to other work, often non-10x projects. If a completed project got noticed or inquiries came in, no one could answer the phone because the people closest to the work had already moved on.\n\nWith permanent staff, we’ll have someone with firsthand project experience available even after work on any completed project.\n\n### Project Successes.\n\n“What do bears and pets have in common?”\n\nIf you were thinking, “They’re both animals”, then you’d be wrong. They’re actually both 10x projects. Many of our projects have delivered results in FY22, but we’ll highlight two: BEARS and PETS.",
      "content2_calloutProject": "Benefits Eligibility Awareness Resource Service (BEARS)",
      "content2": "The BEARS project helps the government meet people where they are. BEARS helps he public learn about government benefits they may be eligible for based on their  life events. For example, a survivor of a natural disaster may be eligible for services like financial aid for home repairs or certain types of tax relief. But completely different agencies offer these benefits. And uncovering what benefits are out there, who’s eligible for them, and how to apply can be confusing and time consuming.\n\nThe problem? This situation burdens people in vulnerable situations. At a difficult time, they have to navigate  complex government bureaucracies when they need help the most.\n\nWe believe that saving people time—the hours it would take to navigate different agency web portals and FAQ pages— could let them do what they really want to do: grieve and recover during hard times. If innovation might help reduce this burden, then it was worth a 10x investment.\n\n**In FY22, we’re closing the project after four successful phases.** We launched the benefits locator tool in beta for a loved one’s death. We’ve handed off the tech stack and responsibility to our capable partners at USA.gov. They  will continue  to scale the benefits locator tool into the future.\n\nAnd when they do, they’ll be sure to include some nice occasions too, like giving birth or retiring. For more on BEARS, see the description on our projects page.",
      "content3_calloutProject": "Deploying Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)",
      "content3": "The goal of Our Deploying PETs project is to challenge the way the government thinks about, uses, and exchanges data. It shows how newly available technologies have opened ways to transform.\n\nOne group of these new technologies is called Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). They allow  computation on granular data that is kept private by design. Through this project, we’re finding out what role PETs can play in digital public service, and to see if adopting them could improve how the government ‘does data.’\n\nThis project is currently in Phase Three, where our teams are testing the research and hypotheses from the earlier phases by building working software.\n\nIn FY22, the US Census Bureau and a group of national statistical agencies from other countries entered into a PET pilot sponsored by the newly created PET Lab at the United Nations.\n\nOne of the teams from the Census Bureau are the folks from [xD](https://www.xd.gov/), who have been working on 10x emerging technology projects for years. The pilot’s goal  is for countries to experiment with PETs and learn what they could do  for government.\n\nIn the pilot, each statistical agency (chosen because of how they expertly manage massive amounts of data) develops a node within their agencies. Each of these nodes can interact with each other—using PET methods—to test open trade data.\n\nIf the pilot proves that PET adoption in government is both technically feasible and valuable, then the pilot could scale to the types of highly sensitive private datasets that PET is designed to use.\n\nWe view this project as a success. Finding committed and capable organizations to partner with to test and adopt our technology is one of the trickiest parts of 10x. This project has gone above and beyond finding a partner.\n\nNot only has xD Census begun scaling PET experiments within the U.S. government, but it has also scaled PET experiments but to other governments—and even the United Nations! No matter what comes out of the pilot implementation, we’ve already made a difference  by introducing a new concept to the government and getting people comfortable with doing government technology differently.",
      "content4": "### American Rescue Plan.\n\n___On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act into law. This  $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package is designed to boost the country’s recovery from the severe economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to addressing the public health and economic crises, the ARP provides emergency funding to upgrade federal information technology infrastructure and address the recent breaches of federal government data systems. The fund that makes 10x possible is called the Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF). The FCSF received $150 million as part of the ARP to support governmentwide citizen-facing services.. Some of that funding came to 10x. We want to be open and transparent about how we use ARP funding. Here are some of the  projects we supported in FY22 using American Rescue Plan Funding.___\n\n",
      "content5_calloutProject": "Identity Alerts for Government",
      "content5": "The federal government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by expanding the eligibility criteria for many existing social safety net programs and created new ways for struggling Americans to get help when they needed it most.\n\nUnfortunately, swindlers, grifters, fraudsters, criminals, troublemakers and scammers took opportunities to benefit from the expanded government assistance. Fraud and identity theft increased exponentially. Identity theft and benefit claims fraud resulted in millions of people suffering financial hardship and the stress of cleaning up their stolen identities—all during a global pandemic.\n\n10x is looking into developing an Identity Alert Service that will allow members of the public to voluntarily sign up to receive notifications when their personal information is used to apply for government services and benefits. This service will build trust and strengthen social safety net programs across the government. It can also help prevent fraud, and could scale to use cases beyond submitting applications for benefits.\n\n10x chose to fund this project out of ARP funding because we saw the direct relationship  between what this project could achieve and what the ARP is all about: \n\nIt’s\n\n- directly related to the pandemic recovery\n\n- could benefit from other 10x efforts (including US Notify, described below),\n\n- would create a better customer experience for the public, and \n\n- helps reimagine government service delivery, which is one of the guiding principles that TTS holds to in releasing ARP funds for investment.\n\n__Identity Alerts for Government is ongoing in Phase Two.__",
      "content6_calloutProject": "US Notify",
      "content6": "Most people get easily accessible communications from the companies whose products they use:\n\n- An SMS message from a bank asking to confirm a large purchase.\n\n- A responsive customer service team that answers email inquiries within one business day.\n\n - Alerts from a telecom provider letting you know about pre-approved available phone upgrades.\n\nBut these easy two-way communications are not as common in the federal  government.  Many of the products or services the government offers  are not consumer-oriented. Instead, they’re intended to help those in need.\n\nA good example is public benefits. To the frustration of many, local governments that administer benefits programs are rarely able to easily update people on their application’s status. If they can’t reliably notify people, agencies can’t let people know about new services they may be eligible for, like disaster assistance or extended unemployment insurance.\n\nThe government should be able to notify the public about things that matter to them, in a way that meets them where they are.\n\nThe work 10x has been doing is the latest effort to date to pursue a multi-channel (SMS, email, etc.) notifications platform available to agencies across the government. There’s a lot of support for this idea at TTS right now, and we’re being encouraged to find the best place for TTS to intervene.\n\nUS Notify has graduated 10x at Phase Three as a fully functional product that allows agencies to send SMS messages. We ended this project at Phase Three because we found a place for it to live and thrive: The Public Benefits Studio within TTS.\n\nThat team will own and develop US Notify further and is actively recruiting customers.\n\n#### Background\n\nFirst, our organization—the Technology Transformation Services (TTS)—felt ready to tackle an idea that had been simmering for a while in the government:  a shared notifications platform.\n\nThis platform is for agencies to use to communicate with the public. In 2018, 10x funded a project called ___Notifications-as-a-Service___. The project got through Phase Two, but we didn’t fund the project for Phase Three because  the timing wasn’t quite right.\n\nBut the landscape has changed since then, and we’re now ready to explore ideas for new shared services. All the research and prototyping that we’ve done in this space is newly relevant. We used it to build and successfully test a messaging capability. \n\nWe’ve also handed off that product to the TTS Public Benefits Studio, a new team within TTS. It  focuses on building and scaling software products that improve public benefits delivery across benefits programs. The Public Benefits Studio will continue to sustain and grow the notifications platform–now called ___US Notify___–into the future."

      "lede": "One great challenge that 10x has grappled with over the years is how to track the impact that our projects deliver once they’ve left our pipeline—something we call “tracing the ripples.”\n\nOur business model emphasizes seed funding over long-term ownership and maintenance. We work hard to ensure that our products can succeed in a post-10x life.\n\nBut  our approach makes it difficult for us to keep up with our projects once they are no longer in our pipeline. This is particularly true when the most meaningful impact might look different from immediate product adoption or financial returns.\n\nFor this year’s Impact Report, we caught up with a few projects that we nurtured from idea to scale. Here’s what became of them.",
      "content_calloutProject": "Federal Grantee Reporting (FGR); Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC)",
      "content": "Back in 2017, 10x funded a project called Federal Grantee Reporting (FGR). It  aimed to improve the user experience for federal grantees during their annual reporting requirements.\n\nThis reporting, traditionally managed by the Census Bureau, is called the single-audit process. The results  move through a massive legacy database called the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC). The purpose of FGR was not to rebuild the FAC as a system, but rather to find ways to make the federal grant reporting experience better for grantees, and more transparent and accountable to the public.\n\n10x funded FGR for all four phases. We  worked with several key stakeholders over the course of the project:\n\n- Census (current system owners),\n\n- the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and\n\n- Health and Human Services (HHS), which given its massive footprint in grant funding, was designated as the Quality Service Management Office (QSMO).\n\nThe QSMO is the agency responsible for ensuring long-term sustainability of the fgederal grants process. We explain more on these relationships and why they mattered below.\n\nThe project deliverables included two functional prototypes:\n\n- The first prototype was called the distiller, which automatically extracts short summaries from audit packages.\n\n- The second prototype used natural language processing (NLP) to help users search for and extract specific text from large datasets.\n\nThese prototypes demonstrated that we could save agencies time, reduce manual data entry errors during the audit process, and vastly improve the user experience while doing so.\n\nAll of the technology we built during FGR used FAC data, but was positioned downstream of the system itself.\n\nWhile FGR delivered value, it didn’t lead to immediate adoption or immediate financial returns.\n\nHowever, the work highlighted how current single audit processes result in data that is difficult for agencies to access and process. It also proved the incredible opportunities for improvement to single audit user experience through the 10x approach to technology innovation. The necessity for improving the grants audit process never went away, and our partners continued working on this thorny problem while we focused on other projects.\n\nA few years after FGR graduated from 10x, circumstances changed. In 2022, GSA received a new mandate for managing the grants audit process, which would involve moving system capabilities and processes from Census to GSA.\n\nDue to the complex transition, stakeholders approached 10x to ask us to oversee the FAC’s initial transition, using what we learned and the relationships we built during the FGR project.\n\nThis current FAC reimagination project is not a traditional 10x project—it’s better described as a post-Phase Four project.  We recognized that we were  uniquely positioned with the relationships we’d built  and the credibility we’ve established to step in  at this critical point.\n\nWe agreed to oversee the transition and then hand off the work. Our colleagues within GSA  will now  see this transformation through to completion.\n\nThis renewed focus set the new, 10x-managed, GSA-staffed FAC team on a path of continuous innovation and modernization. Our current team consists of a cross-functional group of designers, engineers, policy experts, and other professions. The team was  drawn from a mix of existing 10x staff as well as talent from both within and outside TTS.\n\nOur team has been navigating the difficult task of moving policy and technology responsibilities from one agency to another. At the same time we have built—from the ground up—a brand new, user-centered single audits grant system. This system  can meet the needs of an  user base of tens of thousands of people.\n\nModernizing this legacy system unleashed many opportunities to improve the current grants management processes.\n\nThe experience and relationships we gained during the original project bought us credibility among the stakeholders and users. They’ve allowed us  to build out the new system and manage the cross-agency transition. The new 10x-designed FAC went live during the fall of 2022, and will be fully operational to handle audit packages beginning in 2023.",
      "content2_calloutProject": "RPA for SSPs; ASAP",
      "content2": "Also in 2017, 10x funded a  project called Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for System Security Plans (SSP) (RPA for SSPs  for short). Our  goal  was to get good tech into the hands of civil servants faster by automating parts of the security authorization process. Through the RPA for SSPs project, 10x explored the possibility.\n\nNot all 10x projects — indeed not all government innovation programs — can deliver impact right away. We never slowed down RPA for SSPs. We’ve kept it moving for the last two and a half years. Our engineers have been quietly working to translate control language into OSCAL. In FY22, we’ve rebranded the project as ASAP, or Automated Security Authorization Process.\n\nHowever,  government agencies must protect the privacy of their agency’s digital assets. Thus  leads to very strict security requirements for certain technology vendors. Over the  four phases, the ASAP team narrowed the scope to automating parts of the compliance review process that involves agencies, authorization bodies, and a subset of tech companies called Cloud-Service Providers (CSPs) as users.\n\nTo get there, 10x documented the complex compliance process that CSPs sometimes face getting the green light to sell to agencies.\n\nThe most promising path we found was to test if we could express FedRAMP (the Federal Risk Authorization Management Program, which helps CSPs get clearance to conduct business with federal agencies) security requirements into machine-readable computer code . We  first focused  on automating small components of that work. We proved that it could be done at scale. We also identified an opportunity to scale this new capability across the government.\n\nIn FY22, ASAP reached a new milestone. By the end of Phase Four, 10x had proven the feasibility of machine readable security control documentation. The FedRAMP program began accepting SSPs formatted in OSCAL.\n\nAlso, we partnered closely with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) who agreed to help test implementing OSCAL with actual vendors seeking to do business with CMS. The pilot has proven effective, and CMS expects to continue evangelizing the OSCAL framework to future vendors.\n\nThrough ASAP, we’ve made a difference by delivering technology that better equips the government and American businesses to work together to deliver excellent service in the digital age.",

In scientific parlance, “dark matter” refers to everything that makes up the known universe that is neither visible nor detectable by humans using available technology.\n\nAstronomers believe that roughly 85% of the universe is made up of this mysterious phenomenon, and we know and understand very little about it.",
      "content": "What does this concept have to do with 10x? Well, we’ve borrowed the term and applied it to our field of inquiry, i.e., innovation in government technology.\n\nTo us, dark matter is the value that 10x brings to the government that isn’t product-shaped. It’s not the combined value of the applications, research, and APIs we deliver—it’s the ideas we generate along the way.",
      "calloutFullDark": "In order for the government to truly modernize and deliver excellent public service in the digital age, agencies don’t just need better software, they need new ideas for how to tackle long-standing problems. The value of 10x isn’t in the achievements or adoption of any individual product. Rather, the value of 10x is in the ideas it surfaces.",
      "content2": "The above quote came up in a good conversation we had with a federal IT executive several years ago. It illustrates the challenge we’re addressing when looking for dark matter. And this year, the dark matter is all about good conversations, and how starting them is one of the values and unique strengths of government innovation programs.\n\n### Overheard at 10x\n\nMany people who work in office environments have experienced situations where minor side conversations held in the moments just before a meeting begins, or right afterwards when people are shuffling into the hallway, prove to be far more instructive and useful than any formal decisions or discussions held during the actual meeting itself.\n\nBy their very nature, these conversations are never the intended outcome of a meeting, yet their actual value is clear. Spontaneous, informal chatter sparks ideas and reveals information in a way that written agendas often can’t. People are much more willing to whisper their real thoughts to a trusted colleague after a meeting ends than they are to speak their minds in front of a big group.\n\nThese types of serendipitous opportunities enable conversations. But 10x has found that technology also enables  fruitful conversations.T o illustrate the value technology brings to conversations, let’s return briefly to the FGR;FAC project.\n\nThe early years of the FGR project produced two functional prototypes. Like most prototypes, they   validated the technical approach for feasibility, identified design flaws, and demonstrated potential value to the user with an eye towards adoption.\n\nBut looking back over the course of FGR;FAC, it has become clear that the enduring legacy of those early prototypes and research isn’t tied to adoption or incremental improvements to the user’s experience.\n\nThe most enduring impact was that it helped frame conversations within the grants community about what was possible in the massive world of grants technology. The FGR project was not the first time anyone had asked what a modern grants system could look like. Rather, our work built on the work and creativity of countless others before us. But the work we did, the demos we presented, and the open, communicative way we work helped influence conversations that ultimately led to a years-long modernization effort.\n\nBut if conversations are so valuable, why do technologists always emphasize solving user needs and software delivery above all else? Why don’t government technology projects ever start with the explicit goal of sparking conversations?\n\nOne reason is that civil servants want guarantees that their investment is in the best interest of the public and will quickly provide favorable returns. But one of our core beliefs  is that because technology is always changing, it’s risky to predict a future state and then build towards that.\n\nNo matter what else changes on the ground. It’s easy to appease decision-makers by guaranteeing that we know exactly what the solution will look like in two years and exactly what the financial return on an investment will gain.\n\nIt’s far more difficult to ask for funding specifically to start conversations, with no guarantees of immediate reward.\n\nAnother reason is metrics. Not only are conversations not quantifiable, but their influence isn’t always detectable even when they represent most  of the value generated in a project. But the outcomes in FY22 have  challenged this assumption. We   are now looking for ways to show the value of evolving conversations sparked by technology innovations.\n\nOne advantage of conversations is that unlike prototypes, conversations do not need vigilant oversight and developer skills to maintain. Conversations that seemingly ended years ago can be resurrected rather easily and resumed  where they left off if needed. Preserving trusted relationships between community members can have more of a long-term impact  than monitoring dormant repositories for dependency upgrades.\n\nTechnology relies on formal, continuous research to influence how a project can pivot towards the most valuable path forward. But conversations can do this too, without the research or even the intent.\n\nConversations about big topics—like what an ideal grants technology ecosystem might be able to do—withstand changes in circumstances on the ground, compared to technical prototypes that quickly become useless when they can’t grow without constant developer support.\n\nSo what can 10x do with these insights? How do we harness the value of conversations, and contribute to them?\n\nWe’re starting with the assumption that the best way to squeeze value out of conversations is to know which conversations to start in the first place. And a good place to start is by identifying what important conversations are happening that innovation could encourage. We’ve written previously about the opportunity that civil servants have to bring their whole selves to work, and how that can influence our technology priorities.\n\nIn the last few years, our country has been having some very public, passionate conversations about a few topics:\n\n- Defining and showing the  importance of **consent**,\n\n- Clarifying the expectations and rights dealing with **online privacy**; and\n\n- Defining the role that trauma plays in people’s lives.\n\nThese concepts and questions emerge during technology development in government, the same way they emerge online or in the news. We believe that technology can contribute to these conversations in meaningful ways.\n\nIn FY22, we supported several projects that can not only deliver great digital experiences and modern tech capabilities, but that can also contribute to conversations that put any piece of software in the shade.\n\nOne of our FY22 projects was Transparency in Fines and Fees. The goal was to improve the experience  people who have incurred fines and unpaid fees have with the government. We wanted to give them a way to discover what fees they owed and provide a digital way to pay them.  Improving this user experience is worthwhile. If that’s the result of this 10x project, it will be a big success.\n\nBut what if our project could help influence conversations about what government policies may or may not be worth the effort it takes to create and implement them? This project is a good example, because our technology could demonstrate that the effort and money it takes for the government to chase down unpaid fines actually costs more than the value of those fines in the first place.\n\nEven if the fines and fees are in line with government policy, we think there’s value in raising the question of whether or not that policy makes sense on a cost/benefit calculation.\n\n#### Trauma\n\nWe think our __Reimagining Tribal Consultation__ project will contribute to conversations about the effect that hundreds of years of marginalizing indigenous populations has on trust between communities and the government. We also think these conversations should  influence how agencies serve these diverse populations.\n\nThis 10x project isn’t the first time someone has wondered about the effects that trauma has on people or communities. But it’s easy for technologists to ignore these questions when building products and services. This is , especially true considering that companies aren’t required to factor generational trauma into software design.\n\nBut this question does matter, and we're asking it. In fact, we see no other choice but to include this question into our project from the very beginning.\n\nTo really deliver excellent products that solve problems, technologists have to really understand what’s going on with their users. And for public servants, who often aim to serve user groups from marginalized backgrounds, trauma matters.

      "content3": "Another FY22 project we worked on  that can contribute meaningfully to good conversations is our Data Locker project. The goal is to find ways to empower members of the public to have more insight into, and control over, the personal data they share with the government.\n\nThe potential product  would be a digital platform that allowed  members of the public to control the use of their data. Its value would be in saving people  the time and hassle to keep track of important documents and to report the information these documents contain over and over to different parts of the government.\n\nFor example, someone applying for public benefits offered by multiple agencies may need to submit the same personal financial information to each agency individually.\n\nBringing this capability to government would be a big win. But we think contributing to the conversation around expectations of online privacy and consent could be bigger.\n\nIn the world of Big Data, people are growing anxious over what data about them is out there and how it’s being used. A product like a data locker would show how the government takes digital consent and privacy seriously. It  could also influence the  expectations around the exchange and use of personal data in the private sector—from social media monitoring to online ad trackers.\n\nMost importantly, 10x and other innovation programs across the country can start these critical conversations because of\n\n- our experimental outlook,\n\n- our focus on identifying and solving hard problems, and\n\n- our willingness to embrace unknown outcomes.\n\nIf we can launch projects explicitly to start hard conversations, government innovation programs could move the needle of trust in government. If designers in the civil service consistently accounted for  the role that trauma plays in peoples’ lives into their design work, then technology could help influence these conversations for years to come."

We generated a lot of new ideas for ways to improve our program that I’m excited to see develop. One idea I’m particularly excited about is **10x's commitment to establishing discipline-focused guilds for the first time in FY23**. Our program uses talent from more than five separate organizations to staff all of our projects, which means our approach to product development has been informed by the common practices and expectations within each of those organizations. Also, all of us as product managers have our own ideas based on our own experiences working in the field.  The 10x product guild will allow us to codify a core group of programwide principles and practices, and I’m excited to help out.",

I believe 10x has the potential to become a locus for the broader public-interest innovation community as we move into the next fiscal year, and I’m excited to be a part of that. To help us get there, we’re developing disciplinary and thematic working groups, like an engineering guild and early-venture metrics group. In FY23, we’re also developing a speaker series to convene a broad array of like-minded folks who are trying to address similar challenges, both within government and without—and I’m pumped about that.",

I spent much of FY22 on the 10x BEARS Phase Four project, and I’ll likely stay on it in FY23. My main role has  been building out the front-end of the BEARS application, which helps the public navigate government benefits information based on their life experiences. The techstack I’m most used to is React, but BEARS uses a JavaScript framework called Vue.js which is new for me. Learning Vue (and Next.js, which is built on top of Vue) and getting to apply my knowledge of them on the BEARS application has been extremely rewarding for me. I’m excited to keep digging. I’ll also have my eye on at least a few other 10x projects that I’m not staffed to, but find particularly compelling that we’ll have ongoing in FY23. The first project that comes to mind as having huge potential is **Visualizing the Carbon Footprint, currently in Phase Three**.",

      "content": "### Workshops\n\nIf you want to submit an idea but don’t know where to start, 10x can help. We offer virtual workshops that explain exactly what 10x is looking for in a great idea, and they’ll help you construct a great idea of your own. These workshops are great for you and 10-15 of your colleagues. As an bonus, those who attend a workshop are eligible to receive individualized feedback on your idea from a member of the 10x team before you submit the final proposal.\n\n### 10x-in-a-box\n\nIt’s always a pleasure meeting passionate civil servants who are determined to make innovation work for their agencies. Civil servants often reach out to ask 10x for lightweight consulting on how to set up something like 10x within their own agencies.\n\nThe 10x model is designed to function within our agency context. The 10x program  reflects GSA’s mission, TTS’ technology talent, and the funding authorities we adhere to. The 10x model works for us. It might not work for you. We expect any initiative inspired by 10x at other agencies to look different.  We are happy to talk with you about our experience and share some advice on how you might set up your own innovation program in a way that works for your agency, your team, your funding, your mission, etc.\n\n### Project Collaboration\n\nHave any of the projects we’ve covered in this report resonated with you? If you’re interested in learning more about any of our projects, believe you can contribute to them, or want to use them, then don’t be shy! Reach out using the email below, or ask questions in any of our public GitHib repositories, which are linked to on their [project cards](https://10x.gsa.gov/projects/) on our website.\n\nSend us an email at [10x@gsa.gov](mailto:10x@gsa.com) for any of the above.
