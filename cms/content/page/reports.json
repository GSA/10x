Here you’ll find the annual impact reports we’ve released since FY2017. You’ll notice that the first web-friendly impact report is for FY22. We see this change from PDFs to an HTML format as a great metaphor for how we’ve grown as a program.\n\nWhether you’re a policymaker, a member of the press, or even a curious member of the public — we want to demonstrate how our investments do right by you. This is our shot at proving the value of our program and the incredible impact that government innovation can deliver to improve lives. Enjoy!"
