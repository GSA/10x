We spend the smallest possible amount of funding necessary at every phase of a project to determine whether or not it’s an idea worth pursuing. Only about one third of projects we fund will move beyond Phase One. This iterative approach to investing allows us to innovate without overspending, ensuring the products and services produced meet a real, verifiable need in the federal space.\n\nAnd we’re not giving money to agencies directly — our funding isn’t a grant, but an investment into a potential solution. We use the budget for each project to hire and staff the teams that explore and evaluate ideas at each phase.",
