We invite any federal employee to submit an idea for how to use technology to improve public service. \n\nWe start small, validating the idea and increasing the investment as we go, to ensure we’re funding the ideas that deliver the most impact. At least once a year, we evaluate submissions and choose the most promising ones for a deeper dive into their potential impact, feasibility, and scope. We’re talking things like eliminating bias in artificial intelligence, helping people to more quickly identify which benefits they are eligible for, and making it easier to share data across agencies. \n\nSo, how do you want to improve public service?\n\n<Break color=\"accent-warm\" variant=\"wide\" />\n\n</Col>\n\n<Col size=\"12\" desktop=\"4\">\n\n<Card className=\"Home__callout\">\n\n**10x is evaluating 2022 submissions.
