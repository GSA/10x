City of Sacramento employees can voluntarily send us information as part of an idea submission for 10x funding by sending an email message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or by submitting a project idea through our online form. Your idea will be shared with subject-matter experts and the City Manager's Office in order to make selection decisions. 

We cannot accept ideas from the general public.
