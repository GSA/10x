The Eligibility APIs Initiative is exploring how to speed up eligibility decisions by streamlining a) how federal programs communicate policy to states and b) how states integrate eligibility policy into their systems. We’re piloting a model where eligibility rules are written collaboratively by policy and technical staff, in open-source, human readable code. These rules will be hosted as web services - APIs - that can connect to other systems. In some cases, where appropriate, programs could share logic to reduce effort, cost, and risk, and increase reusability and connectivity between each other. We’re partnering with programs at the federal and state levels to understand their unique challenges and learn how to make this model viable across the wide variety of eligibility-based scenarios.
