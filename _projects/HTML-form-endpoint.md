As an organization, TTS recommends the use of static websites. Currently there are limited options for collecting form data on static Federalist sites. Most use specific, restricted forms, or provide a direct email address and rely on the user to have a properly configured email client. We investigated the need for a form endpoint service that would work with Federalist  and found this not to be a pressing need at the moment. Instead, we discovered an opportunity to provide [guidance on how to use existing tools within existing rules, to Federalist users](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/forms/).
