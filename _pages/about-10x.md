10x is an incremental investment fund inside the United States federal government. We fund internal projects that can scale across the federal government or significantly improve how our government builds technology for the public good.

We focus on high-impact ideas from federal civil servants â€” supporting and investing in projects and ideas that might not find the capacity or resources elsewhere. Past projects include the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov), and the [TTS Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/tts).

Our funding source is the Digital Services Fund: a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated for new, good-for-government products and services. 10x is a program that lives within the [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) and is managed by the [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/office-of-products-and-programs).

<h2 class="docs-h2">Calls for ideas</h2>

10x selected a round of projects to start at the Phase One Investigation Level in early August 2019. As always, we are accepting submissions on a rolling basis, and new ideas will be considered for the next round of funding during the next fiscal year.
