<h2 class="docs-h2">Overview</h2>

- First, 10x collects a broad range of ideas.
- Next, we select ideas based on their potential impact and scalability.
- Finally, 10x supports each selected idea in phases, as the project matures.


<h2 class="docs-h2">Diverse ideas from City staff</h2>

10x believes that City staff — with their front row view to the inner workings of City operations and services — are uniquely positioned to identify the key problems that impede our government from achieving its mission. 10x aims to uncover and elevate the most promising ideas from City employees.

To do this, we explore a lot of ideas at once with a small initial investment of resources and support. The goal is to identify the immediate opportunities as well as the risks that an idea might present without spending too much money too quickly. This approach enables us to identify – within a few weeks – ideas and approaches that are most likely to have an impact.

Each subsequent phase of funding allows for a greater investment into an idea, and requires project teams to continue to prove potential impact and demonstrate that a project can thrive. Between phases, we review progress to determine if we should continue investing in a project. This way, only the best ideas receive large investments, and we avoid spending millions of taxpayer dollars on ideas that won’t work.

<h2 class="docs-h2">How 10x selects projects</h2>

10x accepts ideas from federal employees throughout the year. A few times a year, 10x collects all the ideas and evaluates them for funding. The most promising ideas proceed to Phase 1. 

Your idea will be evaluated based on the following three criteria, each given equal weight:

<ul class="line-height-small tablet:line-height-base">
  <li class="text-indent-neg-3 padding-left-3 tablet:text-indent-neg-4 tablet:padding-left-4">
    <img class="display-line-block width-2 tablet:width-3 margin-right-p5 position-relative bottom-2px vertical-align-middle" src="{{ '/assets/img/check.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="check">
    <strong>Clarity.</strong> Does the idea demonstrate an understanding of a real problem and communicate it clearly?</li>
  <li class="text-indent-neg-3 padding-left-3 tablet:text-indent-neg-4 tablet:padding-left-4">
    <img class="display-line-block width-2 tablet:width-3 margin-right-p5 position-relative bottom-2px vertical-align-middle" src="{{ '/assets/img/check.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="check">
    <strong>Cost Savings.</strong> Does the idea have the potential to save money for the City?</li>
  <li class="text-indent-neg-3 padding-left-3 tablet:text-indent-neg-4 tablet:padding-left-4">
    <img class="display-line-block width-2 tablet:width-3 margin-right-p5 position-relative bottom-2px vertical-align-middle" src="{{ '/assets/img/check.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="check">
    <strong>Impact.</strong> Will solving this problem make City government more effective or improve quality of life for City residents?</li>
</ul>

<p>If selected, 10x supports incremental development of the idea, step-by-step, into a sustainable project. This iterative approach, based on modern technology and investment practices, improves the odds that the idea will be successfully implemented while minimizing costs.</p>

<p>10x projects are managed and staffed by project teams within the <a href="https://innovatesac.org/">City's Innovation Team</a> within the <a href="https://www.cityofsacramento.org/Economic-Development">Office of Innovation & Economic Development</a>.</p>


<h2 class="docs-h2">10x project phases</h2>

<div class="usa-card border-color-orange-40v">
  <h3 class="margin-top-0">Identify a problem</h3>
  <p>Point to the pain. We start by gathering ideas from City employees. These proposals are intentionally short — only about 2–3 sentences — to stay focused on a specific, concrete problem. If your idea is selected, 10x will notify and further evaluate the idea with you.</p>
</div>

<div class="usa-card border-color-indigo-warm-30">
  <h3 class="margin-top-0">Phase 1: Investigation</h3>
  <p>Think it through. Accepted ideas spend 2-3 weeks exploring the idea to define what it would take to be successful — uncovering risks, roadblocks, and opportunities. At this point, people who submit ideas are expected to act as subject matter experts for a research and strategy team dedicated to quickly evaluating the idea.</p>
</div>

<div class="usa-card border-color-indigo-warm-40v">
  <h3 class="margin-top-0">Phase 2: Discovery</h3>
  <p>Go deep. Gain a detailed understanding about the problem, relevant stakeholders, potential partners, finances, timeline, and how to scale. Analyze what could go right and wrong, and create an initial strategy to address these issues. For this and later phases, you may choose to work on the team that is developing your idea with supervisor approval.</p>
</div>

<div class="usa-card border-color-indigo-warm-60">
  <h3 class="margin-top-0">Phase 3: Development</h3>
  <p>Build it out and plan for the future. Develop a functional minimum viable product. Create a solution roadmap tied to a user experience strategy. Establish key performance indicators. Estimate the cost and effort required to continue sustainably building and maintaining the solution over the long-term.</p>
</div>

<div class="usa-card border-color-indigo-warm-80">
  <h3 class="margin-top-0">Phase 4: Scale</h3>
  <p>Bring the solution to the largest possible audience.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="docs-h2">Project ownership</h2>

10x is an initiative of the Innovation Team within the Office of Innovation & Economic Development. If your idea is selected, a member of the Innovation Team will serve as project sponsor for your idea to shepherd the project to success. Your role will be that of a subject matter expert and you can be involved in the process as much or as little as you are able. A department director must commit to owning the solution in order for projects to proceed.
