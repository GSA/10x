**For our current round of idea evaluations, 10x is particularly interested in expanding our investment portfolio to include ideas related to:**
* **Disaster management efforts.** These ideas could include problems or opportunities for improving the management of resources that are critical to the government’s handling of emergencies (preparedness, resilience, response, mitigation, and recovery). Areas of interest include how the government might more effectively address the COVID-19 health crisis and ensuing economic damage, as well as natural disasters.
* **Direct public services.** These are digital services for which the primary customer (or end user) is a member of the public, as opposed to agencies, government systems, or government employees. 
* **Diversity, inclusion, and accessibility.** 10x is particularly interested in ideas that further diversity, inclusion and accessibility for all members of the public. Areas of interest could include expanding access to government services for populations that may be traditionally underserved, and/or efforts to ensure equity of service across diverse segments of the population.
In your submission, we also welcome some initial thoughts on how digital services (software, data, and guidance) can help solve the problem at-hand.

If you’d like help putting together an idea or have questions about what we’re looking for, email us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}). We’re happy to connect you with a technology expert or someone to review what you have and make sure your idea is clear.

<h2 class="docs-h2">Examples of ideas 10x has funded</h2>

<div class="usa-card">
  <h3 class="margin-top-0">Federal Grant Reporting</h3>
  <p>“This project will identify opportunities to improve the federal grant reporting process, by eliminating redundancies and creating efficiencies through improved technology — with the goal of generating a prototype that could be adapted across federal programs, thereby increasing federal grant programs’ efficacy to those being served as well as taxpayers’ return on investment.”</p>
</div>

<div class="usa-card">
  <h3 class="margin-top-0">Notifications as a Service</h3>
  <p>“TTS will investigate the opportunity to providing a common solution for government notifications to citizens via email, text message, and other contact methods. Many of the tools that TTS and other agencies build require a notification component, and this project will help TTS understand whether consolidating the ability to send notifications into a shared service available to all agencies would be effective.”</p>
</div>

<div class="usa-card">
  <h3 class="margin-top-0">Guide to the Paperwork Reduction Act</h3>
  <p>“OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is charged with overseeing federal compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Agencies often cite frustration with accessing and understanding OMB’s policies on the PRA, which are spread across numerous inaccessible PDFs. This situation has reduced compliance and created delays in the approval of information collection requests (ICRs). Through outreach to PRA desk officers and agency staff, and in consultation with OIRA, TTS will explore what it would take to modernize the way agencies interact with OMB’s policies in order to design an accessible, user-friendly online interface to respond to agency inquiries.”</p>
