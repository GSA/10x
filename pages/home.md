# 10x

## The Office of Investments in GSA’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS).

# We fund ideas from public servants for products and services that solve problems affecting the experience people have with the government.

10x invests in products and services that possess groundbreaking ideas or technology with the potential for significant return on investment. We’re aiming for 10 times the value of the initial investment to the federal government or the American public, measured through cost savings, improved efficiencies, or scale of impact.

10x funds products and services that scale widely or affect a significant portion of the U.S. population, whether or not the projects are cost-recoverable. 

Our approach is based on modern venture capital practices and is designed to spend fewer taxpayer dollars while also ensuring that the best products and services get funded.
